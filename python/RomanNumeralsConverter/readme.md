# Roman Numerals

## Part I
Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg
* 1 --> I
* 10 --> X
* 7 --> VII
* etc.

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any higher)

## Part II

Write a function to convert in the other direction, ie numeral to digit
